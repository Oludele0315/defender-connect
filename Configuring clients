Configuring the proxy using GPO
Please note with below configuration it is not possible to update Defender as Windows does not use below settings to perform Windows Updates. To update Defender, either use a system-wide proxy setting or an update management tool such as WSUS or SCCM.

GPO: Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds > Configure Authenticated Proxy usage for the Connected User Experience and Telemetry Service
Set to enabled then "Disable Authenticated Proxy usage"

GPO: Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds > Configure connected user experiences and telemetry:
Configure the proxy (http://HOSTNAME_OR_IP:3128)

GPO: Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Defender > Define proxy server for connecting to the network
Configure the proxy (http://HOSTNAME_OR_IP:3128)
